# Facemask-Detection_PyTorch
A practice on applying object detection neural network for mask detection.

An implementation following [Jad Haddad's post](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-built-a-face-mask-detector-for-covid-19-using-pytorch-lightning-67eb3752fd61) on similar topic.

## Usage

### Training
```
python -m train_model
```

### Detecting in video
```
python -m detect_face_video [model path] [video path]
```
